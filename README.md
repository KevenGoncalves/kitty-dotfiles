# Kitty Dotfiles

To have the correct fonts install:

- JetBrains Mono (The normal)
- Symbols Nerd Fonts

This is to avoid to download all the time fonts patched with nerd fonts icons,
just change the font and Nerd Font Icon will work

The styled tab_bar is working because the script to style it is in tab_bar.py,
if dont want the styled tab_bar just delete the file

```bash
